# BMI-CALCULATOR
BMI is a low-cost and simple way to check for those who may be at risk of health problems due to their weight. BMI is determined by dividing a personâ€™s weight in kilograms twice by their height in meters.
This Python program asks for user inputs, validates them, and performs simple calculations via a formula to obtain the BMI index.
